# Python-Projects

These are some beginner python projects made by me.

## Installation

You can use pipreqs to automatically generate a requirements.txt file based on the import statements that the Python script(s) contain. To use pipreqs, assuming that you are in the directory where example.py is located:

```bash
pip install pipreqs
pipreqs .
```

It will generate the following requirements.txt file,
which you can install with:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
